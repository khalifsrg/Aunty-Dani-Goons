<h2>Team Thoughts</h2>
  <br></br>
          <p>
The individual test results from assignment 1 of our team showed that we have a very diverse team in terms of problem-solving, decision making, planning, organisation and communication within the group. Our groups overall results showed that we are very extraverted in which we all share confidents to communicate and put forward our ideas in terms of new content to add and in terms of negative and positive feedback. The overall results also showed that our learning styles are very similar with 80% of our group being predominantly visual and auditory leaners, with these results it shows that our group has to properly plan our step-by-step process in terms of completing the assignment so each of us will be able to  visualise the assignment as well as create a website or document, our auditory learning ability also meant that spoken information and any language barriers that we may have were limited as everyone would be fairly able to retain the information we share. Despite the advantages we showed our group also had negative test results with some group members results showing negative tendencies such as the centre of attention side of the test. This shows that we may have similar characteristics in certain aspects of the team, and we may have advantages over other groups but if we have outliers in the group who are not willing and able to work within the group, this will bring the groups energy down as well as bring the marks down. Our other positive was that our group is a very good thinking group as we can all think for our self’s and make our own decisions when the time came. This is a major advantage because after assigning our own parts we would be more likely to go complete the work individually as our thinking skills are quite high. A positive outlier in the tests was an individual in the group whose leaderships skills were quite high. In teams this is a major positive as having someone who can take control and create order in a group to get the work/job completed.

</p>
<div></div>
<br></br>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<br></br>
<p>

Initially with the traits shown on the test results, we thought we had a perfect team however we struggled on certain aspects of the assignment, but we got through it as everyone was able to cooperate and listen as well as do their own individual parts to help out the team. The leadership skills on certain individuals in the group allowed us to get the assignment started, set meetings and allocate jobs for the whole team. One of the skills we lacked all round was communication but that was due to the independents of each group members who were able to take initiative on their own parts to help create an amazing assignment. The extraverted trait made it so easy for us to communicate when the time came and made us feel like an excellent team because everyone understood each other and made it easier on each other by sharing information.
</p>
<div></div>
<br></br>
<h2>Industry Data</h2>
<br></br>
<p>
In our group the “dream” jobs we provided consisted of, Data Scientist, Program manager, Cyber security advisor, cyber security analyst and Cyber security manager. Each of the employment opportunities will require various skill sets as well as some having a greater load compared to others. In terms of a job which is now very important cyber security managers would be at the top as the world is rapidly entering a society which revolves around the internet. This job is very important as the information of companies, and individuals in society can be miss used and shared around the web which is why cyber security managers are important to ensure all people and their information is safe. In terms of job demand based of the it professions we have listed, cyber security managers and analyst will remain at the top due to the rise in technological use.  The second on this list is program manager this is a highly demanded job as many of the technological advancements we see today have been programmed to complete a certain function. Last on this list is data scientist the job growth hasn’t seen a rapid rise compared to the other jobs however it is still a very important job as businesses need information and analytics. The demand for each of the jobs show that for cyber security and cyber security manager, they is required a great deal of information such as great communication skills and also good problem solving skills this is important as being able to understand certain situations and coming with a solution will lead to greater achievements in these jobs, another skill is attention to detail as one mistake could be devastating to an individual’s lively hood and privacy as well as a business. For data scientist, the skills required include being able to meet and work with deadlines, and also being able to work within a team to work out problems within the business and work within teams, other skills are visual and technical skills to also be able to problem solve and the ability to pay attention to every detail. For Program manager the skills required are great problem solving and thinking skills as well as communication skills and it would be even better to be an extravert to be able to run a team.
<br></br>
Problem solving, Leadership and the ability to manage businesses are highly required skills in the work industry. These are important as more like than not you will be working withing a team and cooperating within the team is important as companies aim to achieve the highest possible efficiency. Problem solving skills are also in demand as many managers and employers look for independent people who will be able to be efficient and be able to make good decisions.
</p>
<br></br>
<h2>IT SPECIFIC SKILLS</h2>
<p>
•	Artificial Intelligence skills
•	Programming
•	Data visualization
</p>
<br></br>
<h2>GENERAL SKILLS</h2>
<p>
•	Translation
•	Sales Leadership
•	Audio Production
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
My opinion for the career I have chosen (data science) has not changed as the rate of job growth is still very high which means demand will like increase allowing me to find employment more easily and much sooner. My skill sets are also suitable to complete the job and ill be able to strive within the industry.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Interview Withe<span> Neil Siregar</span> a Senior IT Consultant </h1>
        <p>
With over 19 years of experience in the IT industry, Neil Siregar has worked in an extensive range of
fields that make him the perfect candidate to study and gather his views on many areas of IT. He has
worked over 10 years with International Business Machines (IBM) on a series of customer engagement
projects as a consultant designing, building and delivering software solutions. The fields that Siregar has
specialises in include Portal, Collaboration Services, B2B Integration, e-Commerce, Web Content
Management, Document Management and Workflow consulting services. Siregar has managed
projects through the complete software development life cycle (SDLC) which involve the skills of sales,
proposals, bidding, scope definition, requirements gathering, resourcing, planning and designing has
allowed him to interact within and consult clients from all over the world such as: Australia, Indonesia,
development, testing, documentation, training and delivery. The projects he has been involved in have
allowed him to be able to work in many countries including: Malaysia, Hong Kong, The Philippines and
China.
<br></br>
Hi Neil, we are extremely grateful for the opportunity you have given us to be able to interview
you. The interview we are about to conduct is a great way for us to gain insight regarding your
life as an IT professional. The responses you provide will serve as an integral part of our research
report that we have been assigned with.

<br></br>

1. As someone who is heavily involved in IT work, what exactly is it that you do on a day-to-day
basis?
My work range is quite vast, as I often do not like to be stuck in one field or area for too long. I
have seen throughout my career that I have gone through a full cycle of IT engagement such as:
Analysis, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy and Support in the IT environment. I am currently
working on projects that heavily require my experience as a software architect. I guess you could
say this is currently my day-to-day work.

<br></br>
2. As you have worked in many different types of industries through their needs from you as a
consultant, what industry have you primarily spent most of your time in?
I have a lot of experience in different fields and it has allowed me to be able to rank the different
industries that I have worked in. If I had to say, the industries that I have spent most of my time in
would be both oil and banking. This is due to the nature of professionalism that is maintained
within the workplaces I have worked in that involve those areas of work. The structural
management is top notch when it comes to oil banking companies respectively.
<br></br>
3. Following on with the last question, which field or industry do you enjoy working in/with the
most?
I haven’t really thought about my favourite field or industry that I have worked in, but I find that I
really enjoy working with oil companies, not just because often the facilities provided are good,
but the challenges that I face in the industry I find are much more engaging compared to other
industries that I have worked in. I’ve realised that when I am given heavier challenges I get
encouraged to learn more and more everyday.
<br></br>
4. What type of IT professionals do you deal with most often through your job?
Just the regulars that you would think of I guess, probably more often project managers and
applications designers, along with application developers.
<br></br>
5. How do you find working in a team setting?
Working in a team setting is interesting. Initially I, along with many others, find that it’s hard
because we still don’t know each other, but after a while of getting to know each other I find that
it always gets easier to communicate due to the build up of chemistry and understanding everyone
has for each other.
How are your interactions with the different individuals you work with?
To be able to interact with different individuals in a team, I have to understand their background,
culture, education and skills. Once I understand those specific aspects about the people I work
with, I see it becomes easier for me to interact with them. How I interact with business people or
how I interact with technical people often requires different approaches. I think I’ve gotten used
to it over the years and it’s just instinct at this point.
<br></br>
6. It is expected that you deal with certain types of clients and/or investors, how do you go about
dealing with them?
Understanding the exact business requirements for the tasks set out for me is the key to be able to
deal with clients and inventors. Without this, it is hard for you to deal with them as it looks like
you know nothing about your job.
How do you present the progress of the work they have assigned for you to do?
Using the Agile method, we report the progress on a daily basis during the morning stand up.
For bigger progress we present on a weekly report to the bigger audiences.
<br></br>
7. In your career, what are the aspects of your skills that you work on the most to improve?
My application development skills. However, even after all these years, I believe that I still
improve with each work day that passes. Today’s skill might not be used within the next 5 years,
therefore you need to keep learning to improve yourself.
How do you deal with your weaknesses as an IT professional?
Keep reading, learning and asking, that is the only way I can think of to improve in the IT world,
along with trial and error.
<br></br>
8. Finally, is it possible for you to display an example of your work that you believe best captures
your idea of the IT industry?
A good example of my work would be integration. Every business must have many systems, e.g.
Salesforce, SAP, JD-Edward, Oracle and many other silo applications. It is impossible to replace
all of them into one single platform, not just because it avoids monopoly but also because the cost
is very expensive. Therefore we need to build a bridge between platforms to enable them to
understand each other, we call this integration.
Part of my job now is to design and develop an integration between various platforms, i,e.
Between Salesforce and SAP, Salesforce and JD Edward and so on and so forth.</p>

  <h2>IT Technologies: </h2>
  <br></br>
  <h2>   Robots: </h2>
          <p>

          The latest and most state-of-the-art robots include the WALKER (bipedal humanoid robot) which is able to interact with people and has the ability to walk smoothly and quickly as well as grab onto and manipulate objects. The Samsung Bot Retail is another robot which has the ability to interact with people, make NFC payments and recognize objects with the front facing camera.
          In these current times robots have proved to be extremely useful, where they can perform tasks humans cannot. These tasks include things such as handling tedium, repetitive activities such as patrols, collecting large amounts of data, extreme sensing, such as the ability to see through walls, detect harmful air qualities or hear sounds that may be too faint for the human ear.
          These robots have proved extremely helpful in countries with a growing ageing population such as Japan. They have been seen as a solution to combat the declining birth rate, ageing population and shrinking workforce. Japan has implemented these robots into nursing homes, offices, schools in order to meet the demands of the workforce and boost their economy instead of hiring from other countries.
        </p>
          <p>
          Besides the increase in productivity, robots have also allowed for lower production costs, and the creation of new jobs in the tech sector, as the demand increases. The lower production costs also mean companies can use their money for other needs and services, and the economy of a country can see a boost as a whole.
          Robots have also drastically improved the strength and speed, as “force multipliers”, greatly improving the manufacturing industries. Robots are capable of lifting heavy objects quickly and safely, helping to fill a shrinking workforce, such as the ageing population. Through the power and speed of robots we have been able to progress much faster, as they are capable of performing stressful, repetitive, cognitive tasks, and making instant decisions and improving processes without the need of human intervention.
</p>
          <p>
          It is predicted that in the near future robots will have the capability to work and operate in fields such as telemarketing, sewer management, tax preparers, store clerks, photograph processing, data analysts and deliver services.
          Artificial intelligence is a main way that robots can be capable of these future tasks, as they have a self-learning feature that allows them to understand patterns and problems within data sets so that they can improve and seek a better solution in the future. This creates an ongoing cycle of improvement allowing for greater innovation and capabilities.
        </p>
          <p>
           Furthermore, the improvement of other technologies such as cameras will allow for better quality robots that could for example, scan places and its surroundings with much clearer vision to easily identify problems such as hazards. These can be seen in cars today the Mercedes EQS model which utilizes the front and rear cameras to create an Augmented Reality of the surrounding, while placing signs and symbols that show the user directions and potential hazards that surrounds them.
         </p>
         <p>
          The likely impact of the further development of robots will lead to a world that progresses at a much greater rate, as machines learn and grow more efficient so will the speed of production and manufacturing. This in turn creates faster growing cities, and the development of facilities such as hospitals could see a greater cut in the time it takes to build. This could be seen as a positive especially in these times as similar events to COVID-19, could be handled much better as hospitals will take less time to make and healthcare machines are more efficient and accurate, greatly changing the construction and medical field.
        </p>
          <p>
          The people most affected by robots positively include the ageing population as they will have robots readily available to take care of them, care for their needs and look after their health. This is important as it will allow for skilled workers to spend their time in other aspects of the workforce rather than staying at home taking care of the elderly.
        </p>
          <p>
          The people most affected negatively by robots include those in the industrial workforce and manufacturing aspects, as their labor jobs could be potentially replaced by cheaper, faster, stronger and more precise robots. However, robots can also be a positive as they can be used by these professionals to assist them with their jobs and increase productivity in areas that were once hard and tiresome. In the future, more jobs will be replaced by robots, which can be seen now through jobs within the manufacturing industry like car production. This is evident through companies such as Holden, which stopped production in Australia, causing many to lose their jobs, as they have been replaced with cheaper robots in other countries such as Thailand.
        </p>
          <p>
          In my daily life, robots have increased efficiency and have replaced the need for me to do jobs that require effort, allowing me to do something more productive. Robots such as the Roomba Robot Vacuum Cleaner, have replaced the need for me to manually vacuum, and their size have allowed for it to reach tighter spaces that I may not have been able to get to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continued improvement of robots can also make my life easier, as I will have access to better technologies that could be used in terms of my safety, health, workload and form of transportation. This could include better healthcare, better security (e.g. home security), lessened workloads such as cleaning. These robots could also benefit my friends and family as they would also feel a lessened work load in terms of their daily life and professional workplace life. This could mean jobs will become less stressful and more efficient for them, giving a better workplace environment.

  <h2>IT Technologies: </h2>
  <br></br>
  <h2>     Autonomous Vehicles:  </h2>
  <br></br>
          <p>


            An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that has the capability of sensing its environment and operating itself without the need for human involvement. A human passenger is not needed to control the vehicle at any time, and they also do not need to be present in the vehicle whatsoever. An autonomous car has the capabilities of a traditional car, being able to go anywhere and do everything a traditional car can do, that an experienced human driver does.
            The market for global autonomous vehicles as of 2019 is currently “at over $54 billion USD and could reach more than ten times that amount by 2026” (enginnering.com).
            Some of the main players that show off state of the art of autonomous vehicles can be found in companies such as the Waymo, Arity, WiTricity, Unity Technologies, Tesla and Mercedes.
            For instance, the Tesla Model X has the ability to use “autopilot”, which according to Tesla is built on a ‘deep neural network’. The autopilot uses cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar to see and sense the surrounding environment. These sensors and cameras provide the drivers with an awareness of their surroundings and blind spots, that they would have missed in a traditional car.  Tesla’s autopilot functions so that the car stay centred in a lane, change lanes, and self-park. Other features also include the car driving itself to where the driver may request.
             <br></br>
            As of now self-driving cars are still imperfect as a result of the technology, and they are limited to only keeping in lanes, changing lanes, keeping speeds, detecting hazards and self-parking.  However, although limited, these features of autonomous vehicles prove to be positive and negative, as it makes transport easier for daily lives, and for instance those with disabilities can be aided through autonomous vehicles. However, since the technology still isn’t perfect there have still been miscalculation through the technology leading to accidents, crashes and even fatalities of human life.
             <br></br>
            In the future the industry hopes to have Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles however as of now the estimated date for this is unclear. It is predicted that autonomous vehicles will gain a momentum by 2028 in terms of progression and improvement to the technologies within it. It is said that over the next few years the major uses of “autonomous highway driving for private vehicles and robo-taxi fleets for urban area will emerge”. (bain.com)
             <br></br>
            The technologies of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) sensors, high resolution cameras (stereo and/or mono), RADAR, LIDAR as well as human machine interfaces (HMI) are technologies that make developments within autonomous driving possible. The further improvement of these technologies are what results in the higher-level autonomous vehicles.
             <br></br>
            The impact of higher-level autonomous vehicles can help reduce the number of crashes on our roads. “Government data identifies that driver behaviours and error are a factor for 94% of crashes”, and through self-driving vehicles these errors can be reduced. (coalitionforfuturemobility.com). As self-driving cars offer safer, more efficient and accessible transport, it will result in more people having a way of transport in their everyday lives, regardless of their circumstances (e.g. disabilities)
             <br></br>
            The disabled community will be most affected as self-driving cars will open up many benefits for the community. Those who are blind, can’t walk, or older, will have worse reflexes and/or memory will be affected positively the most. It will increase employment opportunities as more people can commute, integrate and contribute to the community more actively, easier access to healthcare, decrease the problems of isolation and enable for more social interactions and freedom. Overall, this creates greater employment opportunities for those that may not have access to transport.
             <br></br>
            In my daily life, the use of self-driving cars will not only allow me to get to place easier, and make travelling safer, it will also allow me not to worry about transport if I were ever injured. Travelling without the need to drive will be very different, as I will be able to do other tasks or for example, if I had children, caring to their needs on the road will be much easier. Overall, I can divert my attention and focus to more efficient things.
            <br></br>
            For my family and friends, those that are older and have disabilities will not have to rely on others to drive them. Sell-driving vehicles will greatly help their everyday lives as they are free to travel to places, have access to healthcare at any time as well as escape the feeling of isolation as it promotes social interactions and freedom. Friends and family will be able to visit each other anytime without worrying about getting fatigue from driving or worrying about distance.
            Overall, autonomous vehicles will provide many advantages to everyday life once higher levels of automation are reached.

<p>
What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
  <br><br/>
Cybersecurity is one of the most rapidly growing fields at this current time. It is the development of structures that ensure the protection as well as safety of many things, for the most part it is commonly in regard to ethics and crime. The state-of-the-art technology is the process of preventing or recovering programs, devices and networks from any types of cybersecurity attacks. These cyber-attacks are most commonly conducted in order to access data, with the intention of exploitation. Another very common intention behind these attacks is to steal money from the innocent or major corporations. These cyber threats are actively developing and evolving into major issues. This explains the rapid growth of the cybersecurity field. These threats can lead to the demise and destruction of all businesses alike, small or large. It can be very financially damaging if the correct pre-cautions are not taken.
  <br><br/>
At this current time, one of the most used means of cybersecurity is a Virtual Private Network, also known as ‘VPN’ for short. Used by millions of people around the world, the concept is quite simple. It is in the name, where users connect to the internet via their own private network, rather than using public networks. Immediately, this is preventing their data from being accessed publicly by external entities. The VPN provides anonymity as well as online privacy when browsing the web (eg. History, cookies, passwords, etc). More specifically, the VPN masks your Internet Protocol also known as ‘IP’ address. It does this by assigning a foreign IP to your network, making your actual IP practically untraceable. Encryption allows daily activities such as online shopping or social media browsing to become a safer practice by providing peace of mind to users that their data is not easily accessible by literally anyone in the public.
  <br><br/>
One of the hottest emerging cybersecurity technologies is called User-behaviour analytics. It in a sense records a user’s daily activity and behavioural patterns, then based off that determines whether or not certain activity could potentially be malicious or unintentional. This is done through deep analytics, where the system creates a comparison between the user’s past behaviour and their present. This is a very interesting development for the cybersecurity field as in the past, or up to now, it has always been that once an attacker gets the certain user’s credentials correct and gains access to their account or network, that’s that. They have full control and can do as they please. However, with this new User-behaviour analytics technology, once the attacker has a hold of the enterprise, if they can even access it at all, they still have a very high chance of being rejected or removed as the system is always monitoring the users behaviour for any irregularities.
  <br><br/>
There are many close-knit fields that support the development of cybersecurity greatly. Some immediate examples are cloud-computing and the development of block-chain based systems. It is believed that the development of cloud-computing will have a tremendous impact of the cyber-security field. It will open up many job opportunities as well as room for further development of security infrastructures that are far more secure than what we already have. Many of the current cyber-security technologies for example, firewalls may transition over to cloud based in the near future, making it virtualized and much stronger. The block-chain model is also one of the latest developments in the cyber-security field. It is said to provide security by checking and verifying the identity of both sides within a transaction. The structure of blockchains also makes it almost impossible for attackers to access the internal networks.
  <br><br/>
What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
 <br><br/>
The rapid development of cyber-security technologies has both a good side and bad side. On one hand, the web is becoming a safer place for everyone and people that are not so tech-savvy are able to indulge in their daily activities without having to worry about either their data, or financials being compromised. On the other hand, with such a high rate of development, criminals will always try to be one step ahead. They will always look to find a weak point or loophole that they can extort with every inch of development in this field. The audience that will be affect the most is the average citizen that browses the web. One of the main purposes of cyber-security is to protect people that aren’t able to protect themselves already. As mentioned before cyber-security primarily benefits the average person who is not so tech-savvy, that doesn’t know too much about what they’re actually doing when they open up their phone and join a random wi-fi network. However, another big group that will be affected are the major corporations. The ones with the entrusted data of hundreds of millions of people. These major corporations are also often the target of cyber threats, which is why the development of cyber-security is so essential for them. These on-going developments in the field will also bring about many many job opportunities, especially for the younger generation of people that are more knowledgeable and informed about the field. However, with the addition of job opportunities, it is also possible for some jobs to become redundant. Developments in Artificial Intelligence, a field very closely linked with cyber-security has the potential to destroy many jobs, as they may become more efficient and accurate then current manually operated systems.

How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
 <br></br>
For me personally, it won’t affect me much at the current time. As I already use quite a lot of cyber-security technologies to help keep my information safe and secure. Developments such as block-chain based cyber-security will be something that could potentially affect me greatly in the future as I am interested in learning about block-chain and how it operates. For my family it will affect them quite a lot as they have very little knowledge about being safe on the web and using said cyber-security technologies. The integration of these new developments will help them be safer without them even realising it, which is why it will have such a huge impact on them. On the other hand, for my friends it may not them affect them as much as most of them are extremely tech-savvy and understand at least the basics of staying safe on the internet.

  <h2>Crypto currency</h2>

  What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?
    <br></br>
  Crypto currency allows people to send money to anyone and anywhere. It relies on the basis of peer-to-peer transactions via the block-chain model. It is a digital form of currency, with no connection nor relationship with any major banks. The major feature within the development of crypto currencies is the wealth of safety that is backed up by it, many people now adays are transitioning into using crypto currencies as the payments are extremely secure and are digital entries that are stored into online databases the describe the said transactions. More specifically, crypto currency transactions are encrypted and backed by very advanced coding for the storage of the currencies. The main aim of the rapidly developing field is to provide a safer and more secure means of spending your money. Crypto-currencies are built into the block-chain model, a very new emerging field of technology. These blockchains represent the way in which transactions are documented, where they are segmented into blocks and given a time stamp for when the transaction occurred. These blocks back it almost impossible for any hackers to access or any potential malicious activities to occur.
    <br></br>
  Another layer of added protection in this service is that most crypto currency platforms will almost always have a two-factor authentication feature which would be linked to either your mobile phone or personal email. This makes it much more secure and harder for any attackers to access your finances. However, although it may be extremely secure in some aspects, it is not at all 100% impenetrable. There are multiple crypto currencies such as ‘BitGrail’ that have been compromised by hackers and have resulted in the loss of more than 195 million US dollars. Incidents like this event, which happened in 2018, is what makes the new upcoming crypto currency seem so foreign for the average person. In terms of the direction crypto currency is heading in the coming years, there is quite a bright future surrounding it. Recently Australian government has made it mandatory for corporate entities to record their investments made in via crypto currencies. Although it sounds a bit rough for the part of the companies in question, it has actually opened the door for the crypto sector to officially operate both locally and internationally. Developments such as block-chain model, cyber security and artificial intelligence allow for the crypto currency sector to grow and expand at an exponential rate.
    <br></br>
  What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
    <br></br>
  Crypto currency is likely to impact a very very broad range of things. However it is clear that the most major impact will be on the world’s economy in general. Many investors have and will continue to put their money towards this development and this will in turn impact the other variety of things as before mentioned. Major companies such as Tesla, Paypal and Mogo have already invested millions of dollars into it. These investments obviously impact more than just the company itself, it affects share-holders, stake-holders and also the companies customers. It is in a sense ironic as for a very long time the idea of crypto currency was very foreign and thus many government entities did not support the idea. They even banned and prohibited the use of crypto currency as it was un-traceable and couldn’t be backtracked for tax purposes. However now that developments are rapidly growing, governments are becoming more informed and have re-constructed as well as formed new laws for the use of crypto currency technologies. This will in turn create a wide range of job opportunities for many people throughout society.

  How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
   <br></br>
  Crypto currency has affected me greatly as I am currently investing into the market. Although it is in a sense gambling, I am genuinely interested in the companies that I decide to invest in. In my daily life the rapid development of crypto currency will be very impactful, and it could potentially help me with gaining more intriguing returns. In the case of my friends and family it may not affect them as much because they are not very knowledgeable in regard to this field. However, if it does continue to develop at such a rapid rate it may eventually end up on the phones of my family members. One of the end goals may be for crypto currency to be used over the traditional paper currency, which is why it could potentially affect my family in the future. Things like sending money to foreign countries, online shopping could be made much easier for people such as my mother who indulges in these activities on a daily basis. Although I am already currently using crypto currencies and would say that I am generally quite informed about the sector, I will always have my doubts about the true security of my money. I believe that there will always be that possibility for the currencies to be breached and things to go extremely south. However, with the up-coming generation heavily invested into these sorts of fields, we should be in safe hands.

        <h1 class="section-title"> Project Idea <span>Plant'd</span></h1>
        <h2>Plant’d – The indoor gardening application </h2>
        <p>Our team project idea is an app that targets consumers looking to decorate their home with indoor plants.  Money and time can be wasted by selecting a plant that isn't compatible for the space in which you'd like to plant it in. This app is created to educate, help and save users money and time in the process of decorating and designing. The motivation behind designing this app comes from personal experiences of myself and those around me particularly during the pandemic. During 2020, masses of work forces were sent to work from home, but many lacked the ability to do so efficiently. Having plants, indoor or out, can help with boost productivity, help with creative thinking, concentration and attentiveness. Not to mention the health advantages of having indoor plants can include cleaner air, reducing stress levels and blood pressure levels.
<br></br>
Our aim, to create an app that made choosing plants easy, simple and hassle free. The name of our app is called Plant’d. Plant’d helps users with design placement and makes ordering the plants stress free through a few clicks of a button. We are partnered with wholesale nurseries to help support businesses outside of gardening chains such as Bunnings. This also means that our users have access to discounted plants all while supporting more independent businesses.  The educates user on how to correctly care for their plants and allow them to flourish. We have included features designed to help identify symptoms of sick plants and informs users on how to nurse them back to health. We have also included discussion forum for users to share ideas, provide advice and ask questions to a community of green thumbs.
<br></br>
Our demographic of users will be users between 25-40, they are tech savvy and live busy lifestyles. We aim to provide a smooth process from start to finish that will allow users to create mock-ups that will help the user better visualise their design before purchasing.  The app will require its users to have a baseline knowledge of app usage and the ability to navigate their way around applications. Plant’d has a simplistic and easy to read design allowing for positive user experience.
<br></br>
After looking into the market I could only find applications that allowed users to better look after their plant. There is nothing that actually provides users with a visual aid on how plant placement would look in their space and then connects those users to wholesale suppliers.
<br></br>
Description
In order to download the app, users will require a handheld device with a built-in camera, the ability to download applications as well as an internet connection whether it be via a phone network or Wi-Fi, a smartphone or a tablet. Other equipment users will need, although it's not essential before downloading, is light gardening equipment. The option of purchasing equipment prior to checkout is available and will of course require a debit or credit card to finalise their order.
<br></br>
Once downloaded and opened, the app will ask the user if they are new to the app or if they’d like to register as a new user. Once the registration stage has been completed and the user is logged in, a 'Home' will show. This page will consist of a list of buttons ie.  'Home', 'Design', ‘Health', ‘Suppliers', 'Plant a Question'.
<br></br>
Design - This button is for the users to select when they are ready to take a photo and design. Once clicked, the app will open a camera and want to take a photo of the desired area. Once the photo has been taken, a list of plants will pop up on the right-hand side of the screen (over the photo). The user can then click and drag the plants they want to try over the photo as a mock-up. They are also able to resize the plant to better fit. If they'd like to remove a plant, they can click it and a small 'x' will appear to delete. Once the user has decorated the photo of the room to their liking, they can then click ‘Confirm’, this will guide them to a page where they will check the plants and their pot sizes as well as each plant’s price. Users can also purchase gardening equipment if required for installation. Once their selection is confirmed, the app will guide them through the purchase process with the supplier, they will be able to select delivery or pick-up followed by payment method (credit card, PayPal etc). Upon completion, the user will be sent a tax invoice and order confirmation email and the supplier will be notified to work on and dispatch the order.
<br></br>
Health - This tab is designed to help users determine what is wrong with sick plants they own. Through this section users can search for the plant (if they know the name) or browse images to id the plant. Once located, they can identify what is wrong with the plant and how to remedy it back to health. Whether the plant is sick due to over-watering, under-watering, too much sun, not enough or from an illness/infestation. All illnesses are accompanied by photos to make the process easier as well as recommendations on any products that may help the process. There is also a blurb per plant including their scientific name and basic instructions for care.
<br></br>
Suppliers - This page is a list of all suppliers that have partnered with the app that users purchase plants through. They are wholesale nurseries who offer delivery to the app’s users. In this page, users can find contact information and addresses if they prefer to go and browse plants themselves. This page is similar to that of Google Maps – Displaying all of the business information as well as a visual location on a map.
<br></br>
Plant a question – This section of the app is a discussion forum that allows interaction between users. They can ask questions, provide tips and tricks and receive advice.  Included is a search bar to find if a topic has been previously discussed/ question has been answered. Similar to discord, users can join servers/threads on certain topics, create groups and add other users as friends for private chats.
<br></br> </p>
<h2>Tools, Tech + Skills required</h2><br></br>
<p>
Skills required to bring my project to life mainly is the ability to create app software. I will need someone who is comfortable writing software for an app that is installable for both Apple and Android users. I will also need a graphic designer with the skills to design a user-friendly app that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. With my demographic being men and women between the ages of 25-40 years old, I require the app the be well designed from both a UX and a creative perspective to cater to different levels of user experience and learning capabilities.
<br></br>
If my app is successful, users will be happier in their spaces, they will also have healthier air to breathe. If working from home, it can boost their productivity and efficiency. For those who are older or who suffer from emotional conditions, tending to plants also have an added benefit of keeping the mind active, reduce stress and lower their blood pressure.
Monetarily, our users will reduce, if not stop, the cost of unnecessary and unsuitable pants that die due to being placed/positioned incorrectly as well as mistreating a sick plant.
Overall, the app is designed to better user's spaces and encourage them to invest in a green hobby that helps cognitive function and holds many health benefits.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>s3874850 Tadiwa Makwara
The group worked well overall, at the start we were unorganised and we were not focused and we didn't start until late, some members in the group lacked communication skills but at the end we were able to finish the assignment and present good work, we found it surprising how well we worked together at the end and we were able to collaborate well in order to present the assignment in a neat form. Other members worked very hard in the assignment and deserve credit towards it.

S3895242: Khalif Siregar:
I believe that our group worked well overall in terms of organisation and completing the tasks that were given in the brief. I do however have criticism in regards to the communication between some members in the group, as at times it was somewhat unclear. With some members it was easy to meet up in person before and after class, which facilitated collaboration within the group. I found it surprising how fun it was to create and conduct an interview, I thoroughly enjoyed learning from an experienced IT professional. I found out how hard it actually was to work as a group, as I initially thought that it would mean for a more streamline experience, rather I was more stressed about what others had finished. I was confused alot of the time when communicating to my group, however we eventually cleared it up and moved on to different aspects of the assignment.


S3902231: Mark Jacob Cuevas:
What went well was meeting with some group members in person, which made it much easier to organise which parts each group member was responsible for. It also helped us to keep track on where everybody was at as the deadline approached. This allowed Tadiwa to collect the dawta easier which helped him create the website faster, as well as giving the group more time to work on other sections of the assignment. However some members in the group would need to improve on their communication skills in order to work better and more efficiently with our peers in order to make our tasks and responsibilities clear. I found it surprising that working in a group can prove to me more stressful as some group members may not care as much as others which in turn brings the group down, creating tension and stress towards the other members who were focused on completing the tasks. I have learned that in groups, even if one person fails to do their work, it can cause problems for the rest of the group, despite everyone finishing their given tasks.
